<h4>Does the app run in real time?</h4>
In the Shiny App, the spatial planning problem is solved in real time (should be <60 seconds) based on the input choices the user makes. The
different modules (tabs across the top) of this Shiny App give the user the ability to explore spatial planning scenarios in different ways").
 
<h4>Why is the download button not working?</h4>
Have you run an analysis first? The download relies on results from the analysis based on your selections.
 
<h4>How can I return to the default values of my selections?</h4>
All inputs can be returned to default settings by pressing 'Reset'.
 
<h4>Can I compare more than two spatial plans?</h4>
No, unfortunately only two spatial plans can be compared at the same time. However, you can download the results from each spatial plan you run as a .png file (using the Download Plot button on the Scenario page of the Solve Module and Download Table button on the Details page of the Solve Module), and then insert these into a document summarising many different scenarios.
 
<h4>The app crashed when I tried to use it. Why?</h4>
Sometimes that can happen when the 'Run Analysis' button is pressed too many times without waiting for the results. Since the prioritisations are run live, they can take 10-20 seconds. You will see that an analysis is currently running when vertical bars are bouncing.
 
<h4>Why is it not possible to set the targets to zero?</h4>
Assigning a feature with a target of zero removes it from the prioritization. This is the same as excluding certain features as inputs to the prioritization. Setting targets to zero would mean that all ticked features would not be included in the prioritization.
