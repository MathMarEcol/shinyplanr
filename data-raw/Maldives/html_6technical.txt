<h2>About Spatial Planning</h2>
There are many different types of spatial planning problems that can be formulated, but here we use the minimum set objective (Rodrigues et al., 2000). This is the most common spatial planning problem, whereby we identify areas of higher conservation priority (i.e., areas with unique or multiple species) whilst minimizing the cost to people (Micheli et al., 2013). On land, the cost could be avoiding urban or agricultural areas, and in the ocean it is commonly avoiding valuable fishing (or rational use) areas. Spatial prioritization selects areas for protection based on a range of input information: the conservation objectives; a suite of area-based features to be conserved - such as species and habitats - and informed by the conservation objectives; targets (i.e. the % of the distribution of each species/habitats) that need to be met for each and are also informed by the conservation objectives; and a representation of the cost of protecting an area and precluding its rational use (Serra et al., 2020). By using spatial prioritization, informed conservation decisions can be made whilst considering the different needs, including economic ones, of all stakeholders involved. Alternative designs can be generated based on selection of different conservation features, modifying the targets, and choosing different rational use layers (e.g., different fished species). From the range of possible conservation network configurations, sites can be selected for protection (Ardron et al. 2010).

<h2>Solving the spatial planning problem</h2>
 There are a number of decision-support tools that can be used to solve spatial planning problems (Moilanen et al., 2009). We chose to use the R package prioritizr (Hanson et al., 2021) because it: 1) solves large spatial planning problems faster than other approaches; 2) determines the optimal planning solution for the given inputs; 3) produces a reproducible workflow in R (Beyer et al., 2016); and 4) allows us to produce a Shiny App for communication of outputs and engagement with stakeholders. These benefits of prioritizr are especially relevant for spatial planning in the Weddell Sea because of the numerous spatial planning iterations needed to reach an informed decision.
 <br>
 <br>
 Although each decision-support tool uses different algorithms, they share several characteristics, including: 1) a planning domain; 2) a cost layer; 3) conservation features with representation targets; and 4) an objective function (Moilanen et al., 2009). First, our planning domain is the Weddell Sea, divided into equal-area hexagonal grid cells. Second, the cost layer refers to the rational use layer selected. Third, the conservation features are the selected important and/or representative features with their respective targets. Last, we used the <em>minimum set objective</em> function (Rodrigues et al., 2000) to design spatial plans that meet targets while minimizing the opportunity cost (i.e., minimizing overall conflict with rational use layers). This objective function is by far the most commonly used in spatial prioritization.

 <h2>Creating the feature layers</h2>
 In spatial planning, the value of a conservation feature is usually binary - i.e., 0 (absent) or 1 (present) - in each planning unit. This requires conversion of the output from the continuous output of habitat suitability models using a cutoff. There are many approaches to estimating cutoffs. The key problem is that the more robust approaches based on sensitivity/specificity rely heavily on data on absences, which is problematic given many of the features in the current analysis are based on presence-only data (rather than true absences) and we have no presence data in our region for a few features (and the models were built based solely on data from other regions). Therefore, we have used the percentile approach, which can handle presence-only data. We identified a threshold to apply to the continuous output of species distribution models to obtain binary presence/absence (suitable/not suitable habitat) maps (Radosavljevic and Anderson 2014). We tested a range of percentiles from 0-100% with 0.01% increments.
 <br>
 <br>
 All regions with habitat suitability model output values lower than the model value (= threshold) of the nth percentile of confirmed presences were omitted. The threshold is therefore defined as the predicted suitability value (output of the species distribution model) for the occurrence point at the nth percentile. To test how the selection of a specific percentile affects the resulting binary habitat suitability map, we calculated the change of the area labelled as suitable habitat (presence area). We estimated a percentile at the 'elbow area', i.e., the location in the graph at which the number of cells did not decrease substantially anymore. We then used the median of the resulting percentiles of the features to determine an individual threshold for each species (and breeding stage). The percentiles were estimated using all available presence data and then applied to the study area of WSMPAII. For tracking data, tracking points were used as presence data points. To reduce spatial and temporal correlation within tracking data, we randomly selected one point daily as the presence point for each individual of each species before applying the methodology described above. Where presence-absence data was available, we additionally applied an alternative threshold estimation method, the maximum of the sum of specificity and sensitivity (maxSSS), which is not reliably applicable to presence-only data since true absence points are required.

 <h2>Climate-resilient spatial planning</h2>
 Climate-resilient spatial plans (sometimes called climate-smart spatial plans) try to ensure that MPAs are robust to future impacts of climate change (Morelli et al., 2017; Pacifici et al., 2015). One way to do this is by preferentially placing MPAs in areas that retain their climates over long periods- i.e., in climate refugia (Arafeh-Dalmau et al., 2021). We represent climate refugia here by a climate-resilience metric characterized by areas of low exposure to warming and slow climate velocity. We define the climate exposure that biodiversity could experience as the rate of cliamte warming in a planning unit (&Delta; &#8451; yr<sup>-1</sup>). We also define climate velocity as the speed of isotherm movement with warming (km yr<sup>-1</sup>); the faster the velocity, the further biodiversity moves to cooler locations (Pinsky et al., 2013). Thus, planning units with slower velocity are more likely to retain biodiversity (Arafeh-Dalmau et al., 2021; Brito-Morales et al., 2022).
 <br>
 <br>
 Climate exposure and climate velocity are calculated from the ensemble median of depth-resolved model outputs from 17 Earth System Models for the planning region (Hausfather et al., 2022) forced under the most pessimistic emission scenario (SSP5-8.5; O'Neill et al., 2017). These two measures are then combined into a single climate-resilience metric, with higher metric values indicating greater climate resilience. Therefore, climate-resilient areas are likely to warm less and their biodiversity is more likely to be retained (see Buenafe et al. for more details; Brito-Morales et al., 2022).
 <br>
 <br>
 The climate-resilience metric for each planning unit was then used in the Climate Priority Area Approach (see Buenafe et al., in review for more details). This approach separates the distribution of each feature into: 1) climate-priority areas (i.e., the highest values of the climate-resilience metric) and 2) non-clijmate-priority areas (i.e., the remainder). The Climate Priority Area Approach prioritizes the protection of core climate-resilient areas, while still affording some protection to the rest of the distribution (see Buenafe et al., in review for more details). We set a 100% target for the highest 5% of the climate-resilient metric values (climate-priority areas), and a lower target for the remaining 95% of the distribution (non-climate-priority areas) so that user-specified target for the whole species distribution is maintained (Buenafe et al., 2023). This approach is applied to each Important and Representative features.
 Thus, the prioritization preferentially places protected areas where there are higher values of the climate-resilience metric, whilst still meeting the biodiversity objectives and minimising overlap with rational use areas.
 <br>
 <br>
 Note the climate-resilient plans are based on temperature change and did not consider future changes in pH or O<sub>2</sub> concentration. This is because temperature is usually the main driver of biodiversity patterns (Chawarski et al. 2022), projections of temperature from Earth system models are more reliable than for other variables (Ra&auml;isa&auml;nen, 2007), and temperature-derived metrics are strongly related to changes in biodiversity under climate change (Burrows et al., 2014; Molinos et al. 2016).
 
 <h2>Deriving Rational Use layers</h2>
 The minimum set objective function we used in the prioritization aims to meet the given targets whilst minimising the impact on rational use by selecting particular planning units. We provided five different rational use options, each of which provides an estimate of the plausible lost fishing (i.e., the opportunity cost) of locking up a planning unit in an MPA. The higher the rational use values in a planning unit, the
 more the algorithm will avoid these areas in selecting planning units to lock up.
